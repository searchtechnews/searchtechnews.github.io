Welcome to the Search Technology newsletter. I'm a software engineer who's been interested in search since I discovered Lucene at my first job. My goal with this newsletter is to keep readers informed about search-related software, books, articles, companies, and jobs. There is a lot happening in the search space now, so I plan to cover everything from natural language processing and language models to query understaning and ingest pipelines. I hope you'll join me in exploring the world of search technologies.
